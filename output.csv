First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.Good:- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good- Received next day by 11 AM !Not So Good:- Not that thin, but ok.- Doesn't have Samsung Dex- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :)- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.Feedback- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.Go for it without any doubt.3rd class front camera. 32 MP front camera n looks like 2mp front camera. In very disappointed  with this kind of front camera. Need refund.Dear Amazon & samsung you have broke my trust, Lot of noise in images while capturing photos in low light.Rear Camera getting blur in low light.Lets just begin with the obvious. This phone's quality doesn't meet the claims made.Cons:1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common.2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless.3. Amazon's Policy: In case you don't like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day 'return' policy to 10 day 'replacement' policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer's site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease.Pros:1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light.2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open.3. Sound: Speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark. In a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom.I am using it from 3 days , 6000 mah battery is just for name only, it work for 1-1.25 days only with moderate usage.64mp camera doesn't support zoom, camera doesn't support 60fps video recording.Build quality is not good, plastic back with lots of figure prints in few minutes handling, not look new in few seconds.Face unlock very slow.Heat issue which charging and heavy usageFull charge takes more than 3 hrsWould not recommend to buy , if you are looking  for good camera phonego with other brands like oppo or redmi , giving much better qualitySoftware is no working. No sounds in media, cant attend calls, every 5 mints phone gone to switched off and even though no retraining option.The phone was wrapped in dust. Although it was seal packed, still many dust were on screen and back side. It shows security concerns and Amazon, Samsung and seller must draw its attention. How dust can be reached in seal packed box? Now I'm lacking trust in Amazon,Samsung and seller. Either my phone was used or its components might have replaced, as in brand new phone,there exists no dusts because they are built in factory, but here shows how they are playing with the customer and their product.Phone is nice, large battery backup of more than 2 days, 6.4 display is big, camera is perfect and 6GB ram is enough for daily usage. All things are good. No heating issue.However my only concern is 'dust' and how it came there if its brand new.So I could give 5 star,but now 1 is enough.Beware of Amazon,Samsung and seller."

Park),,Greater Noida,Uttar Pradesh-201308,India","Awesome mobile at this price pointI simply liked it when i unboxed it and saw it at first glance. Its 16.15 cms display is quite impressive. Most of the time i watch movies while travelling to and from office . Hence I can have a better screen view now. The camera is also excellent.Overall a nice phone within a nominal budget. I‚Äôll give it a 5 stars for now.I was looking for a budget smart phone which can perform the entire task for me. I was using MI note 6 and looking for something fresh bcz I was bored with it‚Äôs UI. I explored the content available over internet and waited for it to buy after getting the right fitment against my requirement. I am so excited to share my personal experience after my early purchase of this device. I love taking pictures of mine and surrounding too. So great camera quality is one of my main priority, after using it now I must say that it has the best camera available in this budget.It‚Äôs plastic made but mirror finish back panel is the coolest thing in my blue colour device. I also appreciate the makers for understanding our further need and offering the tempered glass and transparent back cover for device protection. Once you will keep the device handy it will give you a feel of it. With the brand tag line of Vivo ‚ÄúCamera & Music‚Äù it really impressed me.I‚Äôll surely recommend my fellow buyers to buy this cool device. But there is also something which can be improved so writing it in bullet points for your ease..Pros:-‚óè It‚Äôs really a 100% value for money device.‚óè Run on latest version of Android ‚Äú9‚Äù.‚óè In Box soft back cover and tempered glass.‚óè Dedicated kid mode for safety against unwanted operational activity of kids‚óè Finger print sensor in back of the device is at perfectly placed in the reach of fingers and open the device faster.‚óè 5000Ah battery, allows to watch many hours online video‚óè HD+ screen Resolution and balanced colour contrast makes the viewing experience really pleasure and never hurt eyes‚óè Triple camera with AI and image editing options are among the best features for me‚óè Fast charging support with 18 watt inbox adaptor‚óè Snapdragon 665 processor is really a power pack performer even in multitaskingCons:-‚óè Lags in PubG (However in a device with 4 GB it‚Äôs expected as the game itself take 2 GB space)‚óè No headphones included‚óè Front Camera struggles in low light.At the price of 10990 its a great phone for better multitasking. Vivo has finally started improving specs and is doing good with their phones in the segment.I hope my review helped you in making your right decision!The device is too heavy don't go for it. Also it lags a lot despite having a Snapdragon processor of 600 series with 3gb 64 gb storage.Nice looking and very nice phone Battery is good and ... camera is goodDo'nt go for it i received it today, totally disappointed from camera quality provided by vivo,MI 7s & reamle u1 better than it.if u go for camera quality & display never go for itGood phoneBut camera is okNice phone under 9000"

Pls, note I have been using OnePlus from last many years now so my expectations were clear. My experience with the device says that most of the reviews or unboxing things are influenced. Pls, note I have bought it with my own money unlike leading reviewers or unboxing video geeks who get it for free. So pls don't go by them blindly. Go for users reviews who bought them with their own money. So I am writing my 5 days experience with the phone.I am not a gamer or a geek. A regular user who wants to do all the office work on the phone, social media, blogging and vlogging, etc.The last OnePlus phone I was using was Oneplus 5 and was quite happy with it until it screen got broken and replacement cost was higher than the selling price of the device itself.The day it arrived from Amazon I opened it with a lot of excitement which continued till I have held it in my hands.Here are the issues:1. Weight: It weighed too much I felt like holding a brick. And it is thick. When I hold it in one hand for a few minutes I get a deep red pit in my hand (due to blood circulation).2. Camera: Then I had to go for a conference there I tried clicking pictures. Picture quality did not come out well. Still, I thought it may be light or background because of my previous experiences I could not believe it to be not good. So I continued clicking pictures which really missed detailing. As you zoom in it will make it blurred. I have clicked a magazine cover picture with my Oneplus 5 which had only 16 MP camera but pic quality was natural and good. It clicks blur pics may it has to do with image Stabilization.3. Battery:  Battery is avg. All those time I teased my iPhone or Samsung Series colleagues and friends for their battery life. Welcome to the league. This offers an avg battery life. I never carried a charger with me in previous models if I Start with 90% even after two years. But here I have to carry it even for the average usage. I m wondering what would be this phone battery life in a year or more.4. 90 Hz refresh rate is a gimmick to sell this device. It will give you fluid experience but the soon it consumes battery you will always prefer to keep it to 60hz which is an option given in the display settings. If you always stick to a desk or have a power source around you can keep it to 90hz. Not for people who are on the move most of the time. Don't fall for it.5. Sound: It's average. Phone calls are not crisp and clear. At times the caller's voice gets hazy and husky. Voice is even audible to person the person sitting next to me. Even on lower volumes. Speakers volume is loud but the sound quality is not good.6. No premium-feeling anymore. With multiple variants, it has joined the league of Samsung, Mi, Oppo, Vivo. Now they are launching 7t pro on Oct 10 again it is a disappointment for those who bought 7t on day 1. Maybe their R&D or trials have some problem here that in every two months they are launching a new device with an update to the previous faults. Like OnePlus 7 has voice receiver on one side which is right. So if you take calls or hear the phone from left you won't get a clear voice or volume. So they added receivers on both the side in this device.I am still not getting why I have spent Rs 40,000 on it. No camera quality, no battery life, no sound quality on calls, getting wounds on holding it for long.I have always recommended OnePlus devices to everyone around and had high hopes and trust on the brand that I bought it on the day of the launch but with this experience, I won't recommend OnePlus 7t to my colleagues and friends who are planning to upgrade their devices.Detailed review --Design - 4/5+Reduced notch+Premium glass back-Camera bumpPerformance - 5/5+Latest and greatest hardware+Smart optimisationsOS - 4.5/5+Smooth Android experience - Oxygen OSDisplay - 4.5/5+Butter smooth 90 Hz Amoled display - treat to the eyeBattery -3.5/5+Fastest charging ever seen-Less capacityCamera -4/5+Overall good output with all 3 cameras+ Amazing macro mode- Misses details and messes up with Colors sometimesAudio - 4/5+Clear and loud - quality outputAwesome experience..best in class camera... oxygen os..loveI received One Plus 7T 2 days back.

Its smooth, fast and you can't come out of it.The amoeld display is stunning and camera is amazing. Battery backup is also too good.

Go for it.8 Gb Ram128 Gb storage.This is super amazing phone.It is super fast Like bullet Train.Obviously it will never hang.Camera quality is better than OnePlus 7  Because it has triple camera üòç .Design of phone is also amazing.Turbo charging with 3800 mAH battery is too good.My first one+7t & its make me so sad. I received the ph with manufacturing defect in display. Gum came out from the edges of display. How can a consumer aspects from a reputed brand after he paying 40000/- ü§îüò≠üòüü•∫üòìThis phone has great performance, good camera and ambiance. Charging is fast as per the Oneplus standards set in earlier phones. What is concerning me is the heating issue which crops up off and on. The Battery drains quickly so we have to keep it at 60Hz to longer life. Is there anyone else feeling the heating issues?I am among the first to buy this phone with prime membership. Posting this review after a week of using the phone. I can't compare it with other flagships as this is my first one in this range. I loved the 90Hz display and the fingerprint reader is also quite good. There is no lagging issue till now. The battery backup is good but not excellent with such a higher frame rate but man the charging speed is much more than wonderful. I was totally amazed at first. Camera quality is good but the colour sensing needs some improvements. It's a bit warm and not natural as you can see in the photos provided,one without adjustment and the other one with warmth reduced a bit. Speakers are loud and produce decent sound. Haven't checked the selfie camera and the video recording till now."

My experience so far with this:1. Display: It's amazing. Sharpness, brightness and 90Hz displays makes it one of the most beautiful displays.2. Camera: All of my previous mobiles had great cameras. 7t Pro is nothing less than that. If you are a professional photographer, you might find differences. For a normal user, it's just perfect.3. Battery: I am getting a very good battery backup. When I go to bed, it's 30%. 30T Warp charger is a booom.4. Performance: Blazing and Lightning fast.5. One of the USP of OnePlus mobiles is its Oxygen OS. After using iPhone and Samsungs One UI, I can tell you that it's the best. Lots of gestures, shortcuts and very lightweight.The only Con I think it has is its weight. It's on the heavier side but after using it for few days now, I am getting used to it.Go for it guys !! You won't regret.==== A lengthy & brutally honest review. It's worth the read if you plan on purchasing this device. ====I am a Design Specialist by Profession & also into Mobile Photography, hence I was hooked in using the Pixel 2XL. This phone is a worthy upgrade if you're transitioning from Galaxy S9 / Pixel 1 or 2 series / OnePlus 6, 6T & below / iPhone X or 7 and below.OnePlus 7T Pro is only an incremental upgrade over it's predecessor OnePlus 7 Pro.===== What has been improved over the 7 Pro? ====+ Faster Processor. Snapdragon 855 Plus.+ Adreno 640. Better Gaming Performance.+ Better Haptic Motor. Same as the 7T.+ Fast Charging. Warp 30T Technology.+ Brighter Nits (Upto 1000 compared to 800 of 7 Pro)+ Super Macro Mode, Night reading Modes, Android 10 out of the box, Better Nightscape 2.0. These software updates will be eventually updated for the 7 Pro as well.==== What's in the Box? ====OnePlus 7T Pro Device.User Manual.Transparent Silicon Case.SIM Ejector Tool.Warp 30T Charging Brick.Type C USB Cable.And some cool OnePlus Stickers.==== Display ====Firstly, OnePlus 7T Pro has a stunning display over its predecessors. I'm personally not a fan of notches nor do I click a lot of selfies, so I prefer the OnePlus 7T Pro's Fluid Display. Feels more luxurious over the 7T. It's marginally bigger to hold as well. I would recommend using a case so that the edges don't feel slippery. However, you should also note that in different lighting conditions, 7T Pro has glares at the curves due to the rounder corners which I believe is negligible. 90Hz is smoooooth. You would never want to get back to 60Hz once you're used to this.==== Performance ====Snapdragon 855 Plus is one of the best CPUs out there (at the time of writing this review) and with Adrena 640, it takes gaming and multi-tasking to another league. COD & PUB-G juices out at their best with 60FPS & is indeed smooth than imagined. 855 Plus is at par with the A13 Bionic from Apple. Haven't experienced any drops in frames. RAM Management is splendid & 8GB RAM is recommended unless you want to get the 12 Gig McLaren Edition to save on a few seconds everyday.==== Camera ====I honestly have to admit that it's not the best out there as I was expecting a leap from it's predecessors. It still uses the Sony IMX 586 (48 MP) for it's main sensor and it's Telephoto at 2.2X optical (3X lossless) and is at par with iPhone. But when compared with the GCam Mod, the OnePlus Camera seems to have improved a lot from it's previous versions. The Wide Angle is fairly okayish with some distortions being present at the edges. Nightscape is now available for Wide Angle shots too.==== Video ====If you're into Video Recording, then be a bit disappointed to hear this as it isn't the best while it can still take average videos without much shake utilizing the OIS and EIS at 1080P and just OIS at 4K 60FPS. It still doesn't shoot 4K in wide angle. Apple iPhone 11 takes the lead here. OIS and EIS combined together has a lot of warping and rolling shutter which is a turn off for video producers. It's still not an alternate for a Gimbal. The videos look oversaturated too which can be fixed by shooting on a Third Party app like Filmic Pro.==== Software ====This is one of the biggest features for you to switch to the OnePlus. Stock Android was butter smooth while I missed out on a lot of simple gestures like Longer Screenshots, Silence Button, Customized Navigational elements & much more which lacked on the Stock OS from Google. I would say Oxygen OS should be set as a benchmark for Google to include these incremental features on their upcoming flagships. Oxygen OS has presently the best OS Experience for Android.==== Battery ====Warp T30 is super fast. It helps you charge from 0-100 in lesser time than an episode on Netflix. Although not the fastest charger in the industry, it still gets through a day on heavy usage.==== What could've been improved ====- Minor improvements on Camera.- No ToF sensor- No Wireless Charging.- IP Rating.- Better silicon case should be included in their future upgrades.==== Verdict ====No doubt that the ASUS Fans would recommend the ROG 2. ROG 2 is hands down the best gaming phone with 120 HZ Display but lacks majorly on other aspects like software updates, Telephoto Camera, Splash Proof, Build Quality and security patches which are very essential for business professionals or regular consumers. ASUS is also not known to provide regular updates to it's consumers over the OnePlus which has a closely knit community among the developers and has more Brand Value than ASUS & nevertheless to mention that the OnePlus 7T Pro feels premium out of the box.If you're planning to upgrade from a device almost 2 years old then this would be the best upgrade in case you require a phone with no-notch and curved screen. 7T Pro feels very slippery when compared to the 7T. I wish they made smaller devices. Otherwise I would still recommend the 7T which is the best bang for your buck.If you still wish to own this but cannot afford the extra rupee on incremental updates (Fast Charging, 855 Plus) , my suggestion would be is to go for the OnePlus 7 Pro. It's still one of the best devices out there.Its fastest phone that I have ever experienced. There are no hiccups, none what so ever. Overall smooth experience between switching apps and regular functions.The Display is to die for.Magnificent Macro mode and Night mode  in camera.There is just nothing wrong with it.Overall an overwhelming experience.Call of Duty runs flawlessly ...The phone is so fast it takes some getting used to.Charging speed as advertised.No Complaints.Hi, When I open my this most awaited phone, I just saw 2 major Draw Back1st. The Camera Quality, Dear One Plus maker if we paid you 54000.00 (53999.00) then why we compromise with today's main features the CAMERA.The zoom quality is very poor, pic are RIP-UP,DURING ZOOM SHOT OR WHEN YOU SEE THE CAPTURED IMAGE WITH ZOOM.NIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY AND SHOT IS ALSO POORIN NIGHT PICTURES YOU SAW LOTS OF DOTS- RIP-UP.IMAGE NOT CAPTURED IN HIS ORIGINAL COLOR.THERE ARE LOTS OF ISSUES WITH CAMERA QUALITY.SO THINK ABOUT YOUR USERS AND GIVE A BEST QUALITY.Hope ONE PLUS Team look and work on it and solve this issue in his next software updates.Dear Amazon team pass this feedback to ONE PLUS TEAM.One of the best Oneplus phone ever. Superb Amazon üëçüèª One plus 7T pro is far better then iphone 11.Just as I expected, beautiful and powerful.And yes, it works with both my VERIZON & GOOGLE FI sim cards in place. (See Photo)Good seller and fast shipping.So far it has been a really good phone with excellent charge speed and a big HD screen. The Oxygen OS is really intuitive and performs quite well. My only gripe is that this phone drains it's battery pretty fast, and when you put a screen protector on it the fingerprint reader doesn't work hardly at all."

If budget permits then go for RealmeX2 Pro for ‚Çπ30000 or OnePlus 7T for ‚Çπ35000 or more and if it doesn't the go for Realme X2/Redmi K20 for ‚Çπ20000.

Also it has no other competitors in that range.NiceI have been using this phone for 10 days now. It's a total worth for the price. I got it in a exchnage with extra 3,000 offer on exchange. Talking about the device, the screen is emersive and bright, love to watch videos on this device. Cameras are superb. Performence is undoubtedly superb. Battery life is good too, if you don't play PUBG, u will going to get a day life easily or probably more. The phone is bit on the heavier side. I moved from Poco F1 to this one and surely this is heavier than Poco F1.All in all a great purchase.Bought 2 months back as my samsung mobile was dead. Now suddenly K20 became blank screen and only vibration when i try to switch on. I bought this with acko insurance and paid premium. But to have it free pick and drop i need to provide mobile with imie code image etc. Now how can i do it when my own and only mobile is dead? Borrowed a mobile to raise this issue. I guess need to switch to iphone. Total waste of money.Best of the bestDisplay: I just fall in love with this phone's amoled screen.  I use my phone mostly for watching videos on youtube and binge watching on Amazon prime so I'm really happy with this phone's display. Viewing angles and deeper blacks in the display are amazing. If you a movie lover you willl fall in love with this phone. Apart from this the display is buttery smooth and responsive. 60hz display is still good as it consumes less battery. If you haven't used 90hz display is past then you won't gonna miss anything.Performance: It's a beast when it comes to day to day usage. Ram management is great. There's no lag at all. Thanks to the UFS 2.0 storage, the app opening time is very less. The phone boot time is very less and can opened in just few seconds. Gaming performance is great there's no lag at all. You will love playing heavy games Asphalt 9, Call of duty and pubg on it. Phone's has all the sensors in it and picking up all the right spots. Processor is 855 Snapdragon which is the flagship and it won't disappoint you.Battery life: I'm a power user so my phone's battery last for about 6-7 hours which is great. If you are a moderate user you can easily use it for about 1 day easily. There's a bit drop in battery performance with MIUI11.0.3 update but it has improved the overall Performance significantly and to be honest the drop is marginal about 4-5%. I wasn't that impressed with the fast charging via 18 watt charger supplied by Xiaomi with the phone. It takes around 1 hours 35 or 40 mins in fully charging the phone. Though the phone supports 27 watt fast charging and if a 27watt fast charger is used the battery can be charged in around 1 hour 15 mins or 20 mins. Moreove with that charger you can charger around 55% of your battery in just 30 mins. So it would be great if that charger was provided by Xiaomi. But keeping in mind the low cost of the phone it's still a great deal. Moreover, you can buy that 27 watt charger from mi store for just 1000 rs so my suggestion is to go for that charger and use the full potential of your phone.Camera: I'm really impressed with rear camera of this phone. I have compared it with my friend's realme X2 pro phone and this phone is handsomely beating the rear camera of realme X2 pro. The only area where this camera needs improvement is night photography. Though selfie camera wasn't that great. I still think Xiaomi can improve the performance of front camera with a software update. Considering the great potrait shots, wide angle shots and zommed in shots captured by this phone i will give it 8/10. If i have to rate the rear camera only i will give it a 10/10 as this phone is a beast in daylight photography and can easily beat the few high-end expensive phones.OS: I wasn't a big fan of MIUI but now the OS has improved significantly. This phone is running on latest android 10 with MIUI 11. I'm not seeing any ads in MIUI 11 which is great and this OS is highly customisable so I'm gonna give it a 9/10. I have deducted 1 star for few bloatware apps that can't be removed from the phone. But overall the MIUI 11 is smooth and gives you a tons of features which is really cool.Call quality, network reception and wifi speed: I have to say that the network reception is excellent in this device which is the most important thing for me. The network reception in my house is prettty bad and most of the phone's failed in network connectivity but this one is a beast. It has a great network reception and the call quality of the the phone is just outstanding. The wifi speed you get in this device is unmatched and i am just loving it.Audio quality: The audio quality of this phone is great you can listen to Hi Resolution audio songs with ease if you use a earphone that supports high resolution. I'm really happy with the audio quality and it is one of the best. Speaker volume is loud and clear. It has a single bottom firing speaker but it's not gonna disappoint you. I will give it a 10/10 in audio section.So lets look at the overall ratings:Display : 10/10Battery performance: 10/10Fast charging: 8/10Ram management: 10/10Booting time : 10/10Wifi speed: 10/10Network reception: 10/10Call quality: 10/10Wifi speed: 10/10Rear camera: 10/10Selfie camera: 7/10Video recording 8.5/10Audio quality: 10/10It's a value for money phone and I'm gonna give it a 10/10 in value for money section. I recommend you to go for 128 gb storgage and 6 gb ram variant as it will give you more value for money. The cost of 128 gb/6gb varient is 25000 and in deals you can easily get it at around 24000. Moreover, if you exchange an older cheap handset with this one you can significantly reduce the overall cost. I have exchanged my old device and bought this one for 18148 rs.So just go for it."

Also the Ultra Night Mode 2.0 for low light photography is very good and can be ranked next to Huawei P30 PRO.>>With even more money to spend the Samsung S10 PLUS versioncan be better option than One Plus 7 PRO or Oppo Reno10x with Samsung having better display than Oppo. And with surplus money the Huawei P30 pro for ultimate camera performance, but no android or Google app updates after 3 months due to US restrictions on Huawei & Honor.Certainly Oppo Reno 10x is a great all-rounder and I loved my Oppo Reno 10x than my One Plus 7. ¬†üíü Thanks for Amazon for the quick delivery and getting exclusive.>> If price is an issue, One Plus 7 is definitely a good alternative with great specs but lesser camera options and battery. If you are on a budget and want a flagship killer, you might want to wait for Xiaomi‚Äôs Redmi K20 PRO which is planned for release by mid-July and will hopefully be sold cheaper than One Plus 7. Xiaomi usually has a lot of bloatware and advertisements in app but might change. We need to wait and see the comparison for the flagship killer awards. Also Poco F2 to be released soon but will not use the Snapdragon D855.‚ùì ¬†¬†Oppo Reno 10x zoom is not completing for the Flagship Killer title like One Plus and Xiaomi. But this is the best device from Oppo till date and is a perfect all-rounder.UPDATE: After a month of use, i loved this phone than my One Plus 7. The camera is super awesome both for videos and still photos, even in low light conditions. The Color OS 6 upon usage seems to be very good, no lags, very clean and simple interface, always have 3.8-4GB of free RAM even with huge number of application installed. I can reply from notifications, or swipe up notification, options to mark certain notification as unimportant so they don't pop up but remains hidden until we expand (i guess it a PIE feature but very well used by ColorOS6,). Vibrations can be felt on the back of the phone while speaking on call on full volume but not definitely not a deal breaker and its very less and won't feel if you use a case. I feel i had made a perfect choice on buying this phone.I think colour os need to improve for notification and pop-up window Notification issueNotification issueIt's really irritated me when I getting notification pop-up on the screen that popup I am not able to remove or closeWe have to wait till that pop goes off by itselfA notification menu option has a fixed number of the appPop-up windowMany app support pop-up window but it's not working in Reno mobileI am not able to the pop-up window for YouTube, Google map and may another appAnd over implementation for a popup for a few apps is very badWhatsAppI am not able to check WhatsApp msg from notification and even not able to reply themAudioMost worse think in the mobile when I am talking on call then completed communication gap by anyone because it sounds like loudspeaker callEven I didn't on the speakerHeadphoneReno providing headphone but that looks like very cheaper qualityThemesI am not able to find live wallpaper and very less collection for thems optionMultitasking windowWhen I am using multitasking then I am facing an issue like when I click on the second window that click comes on 1st windowMobile WeightI have to use both hands to use this mobile because it's comfortable and very heavy to hold in one handExtend warrantyReno mobile not giving an extended warranty.

The phone is heavy and huge to hold with the cover2. Notification cannot be swiped out from the screen, which is definitely irritating3. Native app's notifications cannot be disabled, huge bummer4.

The selfie camera is good and sexy too :)Most of the bads can be fixed in a software update, hope it comes soon. But the phone sure is bang for the buckat least it is packed in a mammoth box, makes you doubt a second as to what you have broughtPackaging and delivery was good"

First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.Good:- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good- Received next day by 11 AM !Not So Good:- Not that thin, but ok.- Doesn't have Samsung Dex- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :)- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.Feedback- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.Go for it without any doubt.3rd class front camera. 32 MP front camera n looks like 2mp front camera. In very disappointed  with this kind of front camera. Need refund.Dear Amazon & samsung you have broke my trust, Lot of noise in images while capturing photos in low light.Rear Camera getting blur in low light.Lets just begin with the obvious. This phone's quality doesn't meet the claims made.Cons:1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common.2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless.3. Amazon's Policy: In case you don't like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day 'return' policy to 10 day 'replacement' policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer's site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease.Pros:1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light.2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open.3. Sound: Speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark. In a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom.I am using it from 3 days , 6000 mah battery is just for name only, it work for 1-1.25 days only with moderate usage.64mp camera doesn't support zoom, camera doesn't support 60fps video recording.Build quality is not good, plastic back with lots of figure prints in few minutes handling, not look new in few seconds.Face unlock very slow.Heat issue which charging and heavy usageFull charge takes more than 3 hrsWould not recommend to buy , if you are looking  for good camera phonego with other brands like oppo or redmi , giving much better qualitySoftware is no working. No sounds in media, cant attend calls, every 5 mints phone gone to switched off and even though no retraining option.The phone was wrapped in dust. Although it was seal packed, still many dust were on screen and back side. It shows security concerns and Amazon, Samsung and seller must draw its attention. How dust can be reached in seal packed box? Now I'm lacking trust in Amazon,Samsung and seller. Either my phone was used or its components might have replaced, as in brand new phone,there exists no dusts because they are built in factory, but here shows how they are playing with the customer and their product.Phone is nice, large battery backup of more than 2 days, 6.4 display is big, camera is perfect and 6GB ram is enough for daily usage. All things are good. No heating issue.However my only concern is 'dust' and how it came there if its brand new.So I could give 5 star,but now 1 is enough.Beware of Amazon,Samsung and seller."

Battery :- 5/5Two day battery standby for normal easy2.Display:- 4.99/5Super amaload with full hd.. Superb Display3.Design:3/5It has a6000Mah battery,  still looking not bulky. Noglass body,  but who cares after you put a back cover..  In my opinion, don't spend more money for glass body if you uses back covers4. Camera: 3/5Back camera pretty good but front camera's low light output is very low..  many features available such as slow and super slow videos available..5. OS&UI:- 5/5Android 10 with One UI6.Finger print reader and face lock 3/5 Face lock and finger print reader are not so fast7.Processor and performance 3.5/5Exynos 9611 is not meant for PUBG gamers  .. But for me its perfect as I am not a heavy gamer..  No lag ang hang till now..  but processor is outdated..8. Charging :2.5/5. No fast charging.. Provided with a 15W charger and iy takes about 3 Hrs to fully reacharge the phone9. Accessories : 2/5No earphone, No Back cover, No Screenguard..  So order backcover and tempered glass when you placing order as its backbody is plastic amd more prone to scratches..Verdict: For this price  Its the best choice for a non gamer  ...I love this one, and this is best in class, no.1 best budget mobile and Samsung mobile brand also global no.1 brand in the world. Great one, my rating is more than 5star, thanks to Samsung n Amazon.I am writing my review after using it for 6 days.I have bought sumsung phone after 7 years hoping it could be good phone but samsung again disappointed me a lot.They claim it has 6000mAH battery but drain like 3000mAH and it take almost 2.30hrs to charge from 10% to 90% so its fast charging is not a fast charging. Its just a market gimic to clail it monester like features i.e.battery 6000mAH ,15W fast charge ete but reality is far far away from claims.Others features are as per price range but if you thinking for a battery packed phone with fast charge,then I would sugget plz search for others phone in same range.Value for money.I am not a gamer. So can't say about the gaming performance. But for those who are buying it for normal usage, this phone is great. With 6gb ram,128 GB internal storage and Amoled display I am more than satisfied.I have been using Samsung phones from the start. Samsung's Amoled screen is what I am attracted to the most. The feel it gives is simply amazing.But battery dont seem to be a 6000 mah.As far as a non gamer is concerned this phone is the best under this price range.Very Nice Mobile good allVery poor performance. Hangs aloft. Even I don't use any gaming app. In browsing only, this phone lacks. Inspite of having 6 GB RAM. This product serves zero rating. Please don't buy  this. Wastage of money.

Best phone if u want oppo brand name and u are boared to ur old oppo phone... So this review is considering 6800 cost...Pros.1) good features considering cost 6800.2) Size matters 6.5 inch grt3) Speakers are good Dolby4) Comes with classic headphones with good looks and decent sound quality... No other phones now a days comes with headphones...5) Quad camera gives good quality photos...6) Selfie camera is also decent considering cost 68007) 5000mAh battery8) can be use as power bank for other phonesCons:1) Original cost 13990 is huge considering features...Other good brands like MI, VIVO, MOTO, etc sells 48MP camera phones for 12000 and so...2) Accessories like back cover, tempered glass are yet not in market... May be u have to wait for them...Though 1 transparent back cover is included in Mobile Box...This is all about this phone after 24hrs use....I will update if something comes...Best option for exchange, I got it in 9k ,Review score (out of 5)Design : 4.5 (finger print scanner position is bit high), other things like screen size, corners,back panel, camera position are perfect and it's light weight too...Sounds quality : 5/5 (unexpected, dual side stereo and Dolby is awesome, loudness, clarity and effects are far better then any other phone i.e. mi 7 pro, Lenovo, Samsung or honor)Photography : it's similar to other available options in market, day light as usual is very clear and crisp, didn't get time for more night photography, but few repetitive uploaded pics are in night mode with very minimal light which are good.Battery backup : best in this category (10% ~ 3 hours of heavy uses) , for heavy uses 30hours for normal uses it ll go up to 2 days.Performance : not played many games but seems good, while opening any game auto memory cleaner will run,lag and heat issue is not there (checked continuously 1.5 hours)Memory space : 46 GB free space, all basic apps are pre installed, separate as card slot is available (apart from 2 SIM slot), 1.86 GB ram available after all updation, while playing any game also 900 to 1 GB space is availablePros : apart from above mentioned points :1)Front cam is good like other similar phone (mi, real me, honor, Samsung)2) earphones quality/look is very good in this range.3) dual speaker position is in front top of display and near to charging pin, so stereo comes properly4)face detection is fast5)no heating issue while charging /YouTube /gaming6) battery is lasting for more than 4 days on normal usesCons:1) fingerprint scanner position is bit high2) ram 6 GB would have a perfect option3) macro photos are not that good compare to redmi 7 pro4) no fast charger with packGood Phone With ExchangeLowest speed ever seen in android and charger not support to battery. It will be 3 hours to take full chargeOppo makes very nice phone at this price range about quad cameras but we have another option to select Realme smartphones which is comparatively low budget and good cameras...But this phone I like mostly in battery back up with type C charger.. and also like camera clearity because I have already attached some snaps here from my Oppo A5 2020...Overall good performance of this phone and speaker was nice sounds which is have dual atmos..Thanks OppoNycPros- Phone looks actually good  Good battery lifeCons- phone is too heavy  Camera performance not upto the  mark.Go for MI A3 if u don't want the consThe first thing is slow charging of this mobile taking more than 3 hours for full charging.  My friend bought the same mobile but that was 4 gb ram and 64 gb rom in which he got hand free but my mobile was 3 gb ram and 64 rom in which they are not providing hand free. Why?"
